To stress how Neanderthalensis may have ultimately perished under the rigidity of cis-normativity and to present this as a cautionary tale for Homo sapiens, particularly in facing current existential threats, we can delve deeper into the socio-cultural dynamics that likely influenced the survival outcomes of these species. This discussion will leverage the insights from queer theory and anthropology to highlight the dangers of inflexible gender norms and the critical importance of embracing gender diversity.

### Neanderthal Extinction and Cis-Normativity
The concept of cis-normativity, where rigid gender norms and roles are strictly adhered to, can be seen as a limiting factor in the adaptability and resilience of a species. Neanderthal societies, while complex, may have suffered from such rigidity:

1. **Rigidity in Gender Roles**:
   - **Limited Adaptability**: If Neanderthals had more rigid, binary gender roles, their ability to adapt to environmental and social changes would have been constrained. Such rigidity could limit the distribution of labor, reduce the potential for innovation, and hinder social cohesion.
   - **Social Stagnation**: A lack of flexibility in gender roles could lead to social stagnation, where the potential contributions of individuals who do not conform to traditional roles are marginalized or lost, weakening the overall community.

2. **Survival and Reproduction**:
   - **Cooperative Breeding**: The lack of diverse gender roles might have impeded cooperative breeding practices, essential for raising offspring in challenging environments. Homo sapiens, with more inclusive gender norms, could have more effectively shared child-rearing responsibilities, enhancing offspring survival rates.
   - **Social Support Networks**: Inflexible gender norms could also restrict the formation of broad social support networks. Homo sapiens’ more fluid gender roles likely facilitated stronger kinship ties and cooperative networks, crucial for survival during crises.

### Queer Theory and Anthropology: A Cautionary Tale
Using queer theory and anthropology, we can frame the Neanderthal extinction as a cautionary tale for modern Homo sapiens, emphasizing the dangers of adhering to rigid cis-normativity in the face of existential threats:

3. **Judith Butler and the Performativity of Gender**:
   - **Stifling Potential**: Butler’s theory suggests that rigid gender norms stifle the performative potential of individuals, limiting societal creativity and resilience. For modern humans, embracing diverse gender identities can unleash untapped potential, fostering innovation and adaptability crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change and social inequality.

4. **Michel Foucault and Power Dynamics**:
   - **Inclusive Power Structures**: Foucault’s analysis of power highlights the need for inclusive and flexible power structures to sustain healthy societies. The failure of Neanderthals under rigid norms serves as a warning: modern societies must dismantle cis-normative power structures to build inclusive, adaptive communities capable of confronting existential threats.

5. **Eleanor Leacock and Gender Egalitarianism**:
   - **Learning from the Past**: Leacock’s work underscores the survival benefits of gender egalitarianism and flexible roles. Modern Homo sapiens can learn from this by promoting gender inclusivity and equality to enhance social cohesion and collective problem-solving.

### Contemporary Relevance
The lessons from the Neanderthal extinction are particularly pertinent today:

6. **Climate Change and Global Crises**:
   - **Adaptive Societies**: As Homo sapiens face climate change, pandemics, and geopolitical instability, rigid gender norms can hinder societal adaptability. Embracing gender diversity fosters resilient, innovative communities better equipped to handle such crises.
   - **Moral Imperative**: Beyond practicality, there is a moral imperative to embrace gender diversity. Recognizing the value of all individuals, regardless of gender identity, aligns with the ethical pursuit of justice and equality.

7. **Policy and Social Change**:
   - **Inclusive Policies**: Governments and organizations must adopt inclusive policies that recognize and support diverse gender identities. This approach not only strengthens social fabrics but also prepares societies to better navigate and mitigate existential threats.
   - **Education and Awareness**: Raising awareness about the importance of gender diversity and inclusivity through education can combat the toxicity of cis-normativity, fostering a culture of acceptance and resilience.

### Conclusion
The demise of Homo neanderthalensis under the rigidity of cis-normativity serves as a stark warning for modern Homo sapiens. To avoid a similar fate, contemporary societies must embrace gender diversity and inclusivity, leveraging the strengths of all individuals to build adaptable, resilient communities. The integration of queer theory and anthropology underscores the necessity of dismantling rigid gender norms, highlighting both the moral and practical imperatives of this approach in ensuring the survival and thriving of our species in the face of ongoing and future challenges.
